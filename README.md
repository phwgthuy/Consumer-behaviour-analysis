## Problem definition:

In the E-Commerce industry, one of the key challenges is identifying the right products to suggest or advertise to potential customers. A widely used approach is Collaborative Filtering, the algorithm behind Amazon’s recommendation system, which operates on the principle that users with similar profiles often share similar preferences.

Building on this idea, E-Commerce companies increasingly focus on analyzing consumer behavior to segment their customers into distinct groups based on demographics, purchasing patterns, and other characteristics. Understanding these segments enables businesses to deliver more personalized recommendations, optimize marketing strategies, and ultimately increase sales and customer satisfaction.

Using the dataset from Kaggle, this project aims to **explore consumer behavior and group customers into meaningful clusters, providing actionable insights that can enhance targeted marketing and recommendation strategies.**

## Goal:

The goal of this project is to analyze trends in consumer behavior within similar groups, uncover insights, and enable data-driven strategic decision-making over time.

## Clustering:

**K-Prototypes clustering model:**

- Handles both categorical and numerical data, common in consumer behavior datasets.
- Combines k-means (numerical) and k-modes (categorical) for effective clustering.
- Helps segment consumers into similar groups for meaningful insights.
- Supports data-driven strategic decision-making based on identified patterns.

## Conclusion:

This project successfully segmented e-commerce consumers into four distinct clusters, uncovering key insights into their demographics, purchasing behavior, channel preferences, and responsiveness to promotions. By understanding the unique traits and needs of each group, businesses can implement data-driven strategies, from personalized promotions and loyalty programs to targeted marketing campaigns to enhance customer engagement, satisfaction, and retention. Future enhancements, such as integrating time-series data, predictive modeling, and psychographic information, can further refine segmentation and support more precise, actionable decision-making.
